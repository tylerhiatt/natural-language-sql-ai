## Successful Query
**Question:** What are the top-rated songs by john_doe?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT S.title, AVG(LH.rating) AS average_rating
FROM Songs S
JOIN ListeningHistory LH ON S.song_id = LH.song_id
JOIN Users U ON LH.user_id = U.user_id
WHERE U.username = 'john_doe'
GROUP BY S.song_id
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;
```

**Response:** [('Hey Jude', 5.0), ('Here Comes the Sun', 5.0), ('Yesterday', 4.0)]

**Friendly Response:** It looks like the top-rated songs by john_doe are \"Hey Jude\" and \"Here Comes the Sun,\" both receiving a perfect rating of 5.0. \"Yesterday\" follows closely with a rating of 4.0. These ratings indicate that john_doe really enjoys these classic tracks!

**Error:** None

## Unsuccessful Query
I intentionally used a more ambiguous question to see how the model would respond based off which strategy was being implemented. For the zero-shot strategy, the response ended in an error:

**Question:** Which users have engaged with the most popular music?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT U.username, COUNT(LH.song_id) AS engagement_count
FROM Users U
JOIN ListeningHistory LH ON U.user_id = LH.user_id
JOIN Songs S ON LH.song_id = S.song_id
JOIN Artists A ON S.artist_id = A.artist_id
WHERE A.genre IN (
    SELECT genre
    FROM Songs S2
    JOIN Artists A2 ON S2.artist_id = A2.artist_id
    GROUP BY A2.genre
    ORDER BY COUNT(S2.song_id) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
GROUP BY U.user_id
ORDER BY engagement_count DESC;
```

**Response:** [('Classical', Decimal('4.0'), 1), ('Country', Decimal('4.0'), 1), ('Electronic', Decimal('5.0'), 1), ('Hip-Hop', Decimal('5.0'), 1), ('Jazz', Decimal('5.0'), 1), ('Metal', Decimal('5.0'), 1), ('Pop', Decimal('4.3'), 2), ('R&B', Decimal('5.0'), 1), ('Reggae', Decimal('5.0'), 1), ('Rock', Decimal('4.75'), 2)]

**Friendly Response:** Sure! Your query returned the average ratings and the number of users who rated at least one song for different music genres. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:\n\n- **Classical, Country, Electronic, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, R&B, Reggae**: All have perfect average ratings of 5.0, but only one user rated songs in each of these genres.\n- **Pop**: Has an average rating of about 4.33, with 2 users who rated songs.\n- **Rock**: Averages 4.75, also with 2 user ratings.\n\nThis means that while some genres received high ratings, the number of users engaging with each genre varies.

**Error:** column reference \"genre\" is ambiguous LINE 8:     SELECT genre

However, interestingly enough, when using the double-shot strategy, I got a better response, telling me that having a bit more context goes a long way:

**Question:** Which users have engaged with the most popular music?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH PopularSongs AS (
    SELECT song_id
    FROM ListeningHistory
    GROUP BY song_id
    HAVING COUNT(user_id) >= 2  -- Assuming a song must have at least 2 ratings to be considered popular
),
UserEngagement AS (
    SELECT u.user_id, COUNT(lh.song_id) AS engagement_count
    FROM Users u
    JOIN ListeningHistory lh ON u.user_id = lh.user_id
    WHERE lh.song_id IN (SELECT song_id FROM PopularSongs)
    GROUP BY u.user_id
)
SELECT user_id, engagement_count
FROM UserEngagement
ORDER BY engagement_count DESC;
```

**Response:** [(7, 1), (1, 1)]

**Friendly Response:** The result you received indicates that there are two users who have engaged with the most popular music. Specifically, user 7 and user 1 have each engaged with one track of the popular music identified in your query. This means that both users have a connection to the top music selections you were looking at!

**Error:** None

## Strategy Comparison
- **Zero-shot Strategy:** The zero-shot strategy worked well for simpler queries, such as retrieving top-rated songs for a user. However, for more complex queries, like identifying users engaged with the most popular music, it struggled with ambiguous references, resulting in SQL errors.

- **Double-shot Strategy:** This strategy performed better with complex relationships, as it benefited from example-driven learning. It generated more accurate SQL queries but sometimes still encountered issues with specific column references or query logic.

- **Key Takeaway:** While the zero-shot strategy excels in simple queries, the double-shot strategy offers greater flexibility for more complex SQL tasks. However, both strategies require validation of the generated SQL for correctness and optimization.
